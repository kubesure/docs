# kubesure = *kube*netes + sure 

Why Kubesure?? For the lack of a better name and for the love of kubernetes. Project name will change until a cool sanskrit, greek or a latin name is christened. 

Kubesure is an insuretech OSS platform which intends to build pay as you go insurance products. Also, a stable Kubesure will be contributed to Kubernetes community as a real world example for learning. Pls join innovate and spread knowledge.
